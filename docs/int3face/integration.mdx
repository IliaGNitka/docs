These are steps on how to use the Bi[t]fröst Int3face to bridge external tokens to other chains.

## 1. Vault Address Obtaining[​](#1 "Direct link to Vault Address Obtaining")

In order to perform the inbound transfer, it is necessary to obtain a Vault Address. It could be done through the request:

Testnet: https://observer.testnet.int3face.zone/v1/vault_addresses  
Mainnet: https://observer.mainnet.int3face.zone/v1/vault_addresses  

## 2. Sending Inbound Transaction to the bridge[​](#2 "Direct link to Sending Inbound Transaction to the bridge")

To perform a token bridging, send a transaction to a proper vault with a chain-specific memo.
Vault address can be found in [Vault Address Obtaining](#1) section

## UTXO to IBC transactions (#utxo-to-ibc)

In case of UTXO chain to IBC chain transaction it should look like:

```json
Tx {
   ToAddress: vault_address
   Memo: OSMO:osmouseraddress
}
```

## TON to IBC transactions (#ton-to-ibc)

For a TON transfer to IBC chains, the TON-IBC bridge vault contract should be used.
Smart conract payload example:

```
const cell = beginCell()
        .storeUint(0xf9471134, 32) // Deposit Operation Code
        .storeUint(0, 64)
        .storeStringTail("OSMO")
        .storeStringTail(':')
        .storeStringTail(toAddress) // Osmosis recipient address
        .endCell();
```
Where:
  OSMO - the code of recipient's chain
  toAddress – recipient's address on Osmois chain

The transaction message example:
```json
{
        validUntil: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 360,
        messages: [
          {
            address: vault, // Vault address
            amount: toNano(data.amount).toString(),
            payload: cell.toBoc().toString('base64'),
          },
        ],
        network: isMainnet ? "-239" : "-3",
      }
```
Where:
  vault – Vault address obtained in step 1(#1)
  amount – Amount of transferred tokens

## IBC to External Chain Transactions (#ibc-to-external

Bridging to external chain from IBC requires a transaction with specific parameters. 
Transaction message example:
```json
  "messages": [
      {
        "typeUrl": "/ibc.applications.transfer.v1.MsgTransfer",
        "value": {
          "memo": "{\"dest-address\": \"UQB_IYQNLzNJmTqzrbx21u4-qPG6TFe3QtBYdmUoFJNYgvCL\"}",
          "receiver": "int31zlefkpe3g0vvm9a4h0jf9000lmqutlh99h7fsd",
          "sender": "osmo1jssqq9mas2dg5p5x847fz0n58uqqz2nl9q9mhy",
          "sourceChannel": "channel-82819",
          "sourcePort": "transfer",
          "timeoutHeight": {
            "revisionHeight": "0",
            "revisionNumber": "0"
          },
          "timeoutTimestamp": "1734441153000000000",
          "token": {
            "amount": "1100000000",
            "denom": "ibc/DDE1238DCBC338C0FD0700A72CBD64C017B7A646C4A46789ADFB5D47F1E52E38"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
```
Where:
 *dest-address* – Is the target address for the transfer (TON address in this example)
 *receiver* – Static Bridge address. Will be used across all the chains. Value should remain the same: **int31zlefkpe3g0vvm9a4h0jf9000lmqutlh99h7fsd**
 *denom* – Static mappings of tokens. All mappings will be listed in the official documentation. ibc/DDE1238DCBC338C0FD0700A72CBD64C017B7A646C4A46789ADFB5D47F1E52E38 – represents a TON.int3 token
 *amount* – amount of tokens (TON.int3 token in this example)
